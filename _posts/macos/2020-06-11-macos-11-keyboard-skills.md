### In this guide, you'll learn how to unlock the most useful hidden keyboard characters on your Mac.

If you happen to be multilingual, a developer, a statistician or a data scientist, it's likely you already know how to unlock additional symbols when typing on your Mac. But if you aren't, you'll need to take a moment to learn.

### **How to type a check mark**

Want this? √ Type _Option_ and _v_ (or type _Option-4_ for a cent sigil).

### **How to type a copyright symbol**

The Mac shortcut to type a copyright (©) symbol is _Option + g._

### **To infinity and beyond**

Tap _Option + 5_ to reach infinity: ∞

### **How to type an acute accent on your Mac**

To type a grave accent, press _Option_ _and the letter e together_, let go the keys and then press the letter you wish to accentuate: á, é, í, ó, ú.

### **How to type a grave accent on your Mac**

It's similar for a downwards accent on a letter: press _Option and ` together_, let go the keys and then press the letter you want accented: à, è, ì, ò, ù.

### **How to type other accents on your Mac**

There are other accents you can type on your Mac:

*   Option + i, letter â, ê, ô, î, û
*   Option + n, letter ã, ñ, õ
*   Option + u, letter ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ÿ
*   Option, A or a å, Å
*   Option + ' æ, Æ
*   Option + q, Q œ, Œ
*   Option + c or C ç, Ç
*   Option + o or O ø, Ø

### **How to type an upside-down question mark**

If you’ve ever wanted to soup-up your Twitter name with an upside-down question mark like the cool kids on Netscape Navigator, here’s how to do it:

_Shift + Option + ? = ¿_

_Shift and Option_ together unlock all kinds of additional characters. Press _Option + Shift 2_ to type ™, for example.

### **How to type an Apple logo**

Another example: just press _Option + Shift + k_ to type an Apple logo: 

### **How to type emojis**

The easiest way to type emoji on your Mac is to press _Control + Command + Space_ to summon the emoji character palette at the point in your document at which your cursor sits. Now find the one you want to use and press it to insert it.

### Want more characters?

If you don’t need to use unusual characters in your work often enough to learn where they are, but need to do so on an ad hoc basis, here’s what to do:

*   Open _System Preferences>Keyboard_ and check ‘S_how keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar_’.
*   A new _Menu_ item will appear; click this to get to the character and emoji viewers.
*   Now you can see what characters are available as you press different keys.

### Use Text Replacement

You can also create your own keyboard shortcuts for items you may write frequently. These can be words, phrases, or even complete paragraphs. Once you set one of these shortcuts up, all you’ll need to do to type one of them is to recall the code you associated with the phrase. The only problem is these only work inside applications that support the feature (not Word). Here is how to do it.

*   Open the _Keyboard_ item in _System Preferences._
*   Select the _Text_ pane and tap the _plus (+)_

A new text entry field appears. Type the shortcut code you _want to use_ in the left-field and the text you want created when you use that code in the column to its right.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Hope this helps.
