<h3>In this guide, you'll learn how to unlock the most useful hidden keyboard characters on your Mac.
</h3>

<p>If you happen to be multilingual, a developer, a statistician or a data scientist, it’s likely you already know how
    to unlock additional symbols when typing on your Mac. But if you aren't, you’ll need to take a moment to learn.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>How to type a check mark</strong>
</h3>
<p>Want this? √ Type <em>Option</em> and <em>v</em> (or
    type <em>Option-4</em> for a cent sigil).
</p>
<h3><strong>How to type a copyright symbol</strong>
</h3>
<p>The Mac shortcut to type a copyright (©) symbol is <em>Option + g.</em></p>
<h3><strong>To infinity and
    beyond</strong></h3>
<p>Tap <em>Option + 5</em> to reach infinity: ∞</p>
<h3><strong>How to type an acute accent
    on your Mac</strong></h3><p>To type a grave accent, press <em>Option</em> <em>and the letter e together</em>, let go
    the keys and then press the letter you wish to accentuate: á, é, í, ó, ú.</p><h3><strong>How to type a
    grave accent on your Mac</strong></h3><p>It’s similar for a downwards accent on a letter: press <em>Option and `
    together</em>, let go the keys and then press the letter you want accented: à, è, ì, ò, ù.</p><h3>
    <strong>How to type other accents on your Mac</strong></h3><p>There are other accents you can type on your Mac:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Option + i, letter â, ê, ô, î, û</li>
    <li>Option + n, letter ã, ñ, õ</li>
    <li>Option + u, letter ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ÿ</li>
    <li>Option, A or a å, Å</li>
    <li>Option + ‘ æ, Æ</li>
    <li>Option + q, Q œ, Œ</li>
    <li>Option + c or C ç, Ç</li>
    <li>Option + o or O ø, Ø</li>
</ul><h3><strong>How to type an upside-down question mark</strong></h3><p>If you’ve ever wanted to soup-up
    your Twitter name with an upside-down question mark like the cool kids on Netscape Navigator, here’s how to do
    it:</p>
<p><em>Shift + Option + ? = ¿</em></p><p><em>Shift
    and Option </em>together unlock all kinds of additional characters. Press <em>Option + Shift 2 </em>to type ™, for
    example.</p><h3><strong>How to type an Apple logo</strong></h3><p>Another example: just press <em>Option
    + Shift + k </em>to type an Apple logo: </p><h3><strong>How to type emojis</strong></h3><p>The easiest
    way to type emoji on your Mac is to press <em>Control + Command + Space </em>to summon the emoji character palette
    at the point in your document at which your cursor sits. Now find the one you want to use and press it to insert it.
</p><h3>Want more characters?</h3><p>If you don’t need to use unusual characters in your work often enough to learn
    where they are, but need to do so on an ad hoc basis, here’s what to do:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open <em>System Preferences&gt;Keyboard</em> and check ‘S<em>how keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar</em>’.
    </li>
    <li>A new<em> Menu</em> item will appear; click this to get to the character and emoji viewers.</li>
    <li>Now you can see what characters are available as you press different keys.</li>
</ul><h3>Use Text Replacement</h3><p>You can also create your own keyboard shortcuts for items you may write frequently.
    These can be words, phrases, or even complete paragraphs. Once you set one of these shortcuts up, all you’ll need to
    do to type one of them is to recall the code you associated with the phrase. The only problem is these only work
    inside applications that support the feature (not Word). Here is how to do it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open the <em>Keyboard </em>item in <em>System Preferences.</em></li>
    <li>Select the <em>Text </em>pane and tap the <em>plus (+)</em></li>
</ul><p>A new text entry field appears. Type the shortcut code you <em>want to use </em>in the left-field and the text
    you want created when you use that code in the column to its right.</p>

<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Hope this helps.</p>
