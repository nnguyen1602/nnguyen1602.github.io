<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1. Define the term "IT-Security"</h3>
<p>
    Protection of information and information systems against unauthorized access and modification and availability of
    information system services for legitimate users, including measures to thwart, discover or log threats. Protection
    against unauthorized access must be ensured during storage, processing or in transit.
</p>

<h3>2. What are the aims of “IT-Security”? Describe each aim briefly and present an example.</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confidentiality: Protection against unauthorized access</li>
        <li>Integrity: Protection against unauthorized modification</li>
        <li>Availability: Resources and Services are available for legitimate users</li>
        <li>Authenticity and authentication: Unambiguous idenfification of the sender of information or a communication
            peer</li>
        <li>Nonrepudiation: Ability to prove that a given message was sent and by whom to a third party not involved in
            communication</li>
        <li>Authorization: Accces to resources is limited to certain group of (authenticated) users</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>3. What are passive and active attacks and why is the distinction between them helpful in practice?</h3>
<p>
    Passive Attacks
    <ul>
        <li>Attacker does not actively participate</li>
        <li>Example: Snooping and wiretapping</li>
        <li>Difficult to discover</li>
        <li>Preventive means of protection against active attacks</li>
    </ul>
    Active attacks
    <ul>
        <li>Attacker actively manipulates systems or data</li>
        <li>Manipulation of data or systems</li>
        <li>Attacker often leaves traces</li>
        <li>Prevention and Detection possible</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>II. Cryptographical Principles and Methods</h2>
<p>
    Cryptographic model: <br>
    <img src="/resource/img/crypto-model.png" width="600" />
    <br>
    Classical Encryption Methods:
    <ul>
        <li>Substitution</li>
        <li>Transposition</li>
        <li>Product cipher</li>
        <li>Applying multiple substitution and/or transposition</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>1. Symmetrical Encryption Schemes</h3>

    Cipher Block Chaining <br>
    Cipher Feedback Mode <br>
    Output Feedback Mode <br>
    Counter Mode
</p>

<h2>III. Authentication</h2>
<p>
    Authentication and authenticity: Unambiguous identification of the sender of information or a communication peer
</p>

<h3>1. Factors for Authentication</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>What you know: password</li>
        <li>What you have: token</li>
        <li>What you are: biometric</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>2. Methods</h3>
<p>
    Size of Passowrd domain: <br>
    <img src="/resource/img/pass-size.png" width="600" />
    <br>
    <br>
    Authentication by Symmetric Key <br>
    <img src="/resource/img/authsym.png" width="600" />
    <br>
    <br>
    Authentication by Public Key Cryptography <br>
    <img src="/resource/img/authpub.png" width="600" />
    <br>
</p>

<h3>3. Digital Signatures</h3>
<p>
    Root Certificate <br>
    Certificate for products (servers...)<br>
    Certificate Request (come along with csr file)<br>
    Public-private key pair <br>
    <br>

    The CA have its own signed certificate, and private key.<br>
    An organization create public-private key pair, and certificate signed request.<br>
    The CA must sign the CSR with its private key and send back to organization.<br>

    <br>
    From the internet: <br>
    You usually start by generating a private key / public key pair, followed by a CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
    The CSR would contain a copy of the public key and some basic information about the subject. Once you've generated
    a CSR, you would then submit that CSR to a CA.

    Once the CA is done signing the cert, the CA would then return the cert to you and you would then import that
    signed certificate to your server.

    If we recall our discussion on digital certificates, the signed cert would contain some basic information regarding
    the subject (your site), the issuer, the validity period, the public key (of your site), and a digital signature of
    the cert signed using the CA's private key.
    <br>
    In summary,
    You generate a private key / public key pair and submit a CSR to a Certificate Authority. The contents of the CSR
    will form part of the final server certificate.
    The CA verifies whether the information on the certificate is correct and then signs it using its (the CA's)
    private key. It then returns the signed server certificate to you.
    You import the signed server certificate unto your server.
