<h3>
    Process
</h3>
<div class="child">
    <p>
        A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier). To see information about your
        processes, with their associated PID and status, type
    </p>
    <code>
        $ ps
    </code>
    <p>
        A process may be in the foreground, in the background, or be suspended. In general the shell does not return the
        UNIX prompt until the current process has finished executing.
        <br>
        Some processes take a long time to run and hold up the terminal. Backgrounding a long process has the effect
        that
        the UNIX prompt is returned immediately, and other tasks can be carried out while the original process continues
        executing.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>
        Running process in background: add <code>&</code> to the end of the command line
    </strong>
</p>
<div class="child">
    <code>
        $ [command] &
    </code>
    <p>
        For example: <code>$ sleep 10 &</code>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        You can suspend the process running in the foreground by typing ^Z, i.e.hold down the [Ctrl] key and type [z]. Then to put it in the background, type
    </p>
    <code>
        $ bg
    </code>
</div>

<h3>
    Listing suspended and background processes
</h3>

<div class="child">
    <p>
        When a process is running, backgrounded or suspended, it will be entered onto a list along with a job number. To examine this list, type
    </p>
    <code>$ jobs</code>
    <p>
        To restart (foreground) a suspended processes, type
    </p>
    <code>
        $ fg [jobnumber]
    </code>
    <p>
        <code>fg</code>: foregrounds the last suspended process
    </p>
</div>
<h3>
    Kill a process
</h3>

<div class="child">
    <p>
        To kill a suspended or background process, type
    </p>
    <code>
        $ kill [jobnumber]
    </code>
    <p>
        Force to kill:
    </p>
    <code>
        $ kill -9 [jobnumber]
    </code>
</div>
