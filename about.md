<h3>
    Why SoftsPlay?
</h3>

<p>
    Recently, I learned a lot of new things in the computer and network world. But my memory is limited, I cannot remember all,
    and I have to google over again every time I want to reuse the knowledge. Thus, I come up with an idea, which is making a place
    to store my own knowledge. This could be easy if I just use the typing documents application (like Pages, or Microsoft Word), but
    then I realized it would be much better if I store them on my own webpage. By this way, I can also share my knowledge for everyone that needs, and also people
    can help me to improve what I have learned.
    <br>
    The name SoftsPlay comes from two words Software and Playground. For me, doing anything with computer software is always joyful, it is like playing
    more than studying or working.
